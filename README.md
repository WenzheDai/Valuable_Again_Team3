<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The objective of our application is to provide a web platform for information sharing, discussion and communication for people who want to buy second-hand items and sell second-hand items in Glasgow.
On this platform, everyone can browse and retrieve the products they want.
Users can create their own account and post second-hand items they want to sell, as well as pre-order the items they want and get the contact details and general location of the seller.
Sellers can view the pre-order information for their items, as well as update their item information and confirm when the transaction is completed, and the item is automatically taken off the shelf.
